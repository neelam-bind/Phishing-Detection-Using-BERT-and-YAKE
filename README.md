# 🛡️ Phishing Detection using NLP 🧠

Welcome to the **Phishing Detection using NLP** project! This repository explores how cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, powered by BERT and YAKE, can help improve cybersecurity by detecting phishing attacks in various forms.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to:
- 🕵️‍♀️ Identify phishing attempts with deep contextual analysis.
- 📜 Detect manipulative patterns in phishing emails and SMS (smishing).
- 🔍 Address challenges like dataset imbalance, interpretability, and efficiency to create robust phishing detection systems.

---

## 📖 **Scope**
- 🚨 Analyze phishing attacks in forms such as:
  - Email Phishing 📧
  - SMS Phishing (Smishing) 📱
- 🌐 Leverage **BERT's contextual capabilities** to detect subtle phishing cues.
- 🔑 Use **YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor)** to isolate suspicious phrases and malicious links.
- 🛠️ Propose a framework for integrating NLP techniques into real-world phishing detection systems.

---

## ⚙️ **Techniques and Tools**
### 1️⃣ **BERT**
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Transformer-based, bidirectional contextual understanding.
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Detect manipulative or suspicious language patterns in phishing texts.
- 💡 **Advancements**: Fine-tuning on phishing-specific datasets improves accuracy.

### 2️⃣ **YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor)**
- ⚡ **Feature**: Lightweight, unsupervised keyword extractor.
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Identify phishing cues like malicious links or keywords.
- 🔗 **Integration**: Works alongside BERT for enhanced phishing detection.

## 💡 **Applications**
### 📧 **Email Phishing Detection**
- 🛑 Identifies red flags like:
  - Urgency in language ⚡
  - Suspicious requests 🙅‍♂️
  - Embedded URLs 🔗
- 🧠 Fine-tuned on phishing datasets for high precision.

### 📱 **SMS Phishing Detection (Smishing)**
- 📏 Analyzes the short nature of SMS.
- 🔗 Combines YAKE's keyword extraction with BERT’s contextual understanding for precise detection.

---

## 🚧 **Research Gaps**
1. ⚖️ **Dataset Imbalance**
   - Small and skewed datasets affect model performance.
   - Future work: Employ oversampling and synthetic data generation for diverse datasets.

2. 🕵️‍♂️ **Interpretability Challenges**
   - Complexity in BERT's predictions limits transparency.
   - Future work: Integrate explainability tools like SHAP to enhance trust.

---

## 📌 **Conclusion**
By combining the strengths of **BERT** and **YAKE**, this project demonstrates how advanced NLP techniques can significantly improve phishing detection. While challenges like dataset imbalance and computational efficiency persist, addressing these issues will pave the way for scalable and reliable phishing detection systems.

### 🚀 **Future Directions**
- 🌍 Explore multilingual datasets.
- ⏱️ Optimize for real-time detection.
- 🖥️ Enhance user interfaces for better adoption.
