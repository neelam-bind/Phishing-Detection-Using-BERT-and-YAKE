## 🎯 **Objective**  
To leverage **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and **YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor)** for:  
- 🔍 Identifying manipulative patterns in phishing emails and SMS (smishing).  
- 🛠️ Addressing challenges such as dataset imbalance, interpretability, and efficiency.  
- 🚀 Building robust phishing detection systems suitable for real-world applications.

## 📝 **Scope**  
1. Analyze **email phishing** 📧 and **smishing (SMS phishing)** 📱.  
2. Utilize **BERT’s bidirectional contextual capabilities** to detect subtle phishing cues.  
3. Enhance feature extraction with **YAKE** for identifying malicious links and suspicious keywords.  
4. Propose scalable solutions for real-world phishing detection.

## 🛠️ **Key Techniques**  

### 1️⃣ **BERT**  
- **Purpose**: Captures bidirectional context to detect subtle manipulations in phishing texts.  
- **Applications**: Analyzes phishing emails and SMS.  
- **Advancements**: Domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances detection accuracy.  

### 2️⃣ **YAKE**  
- **Purpose**: Extracts keywords and phrases critical for phishing classification.  
- **Applications**: Complements BERT by isolating phishing indicators in text.  
- **Integration**: Works alongside BERT for feature-rich detection systems.

## 💡 **Applications**  

### 📧 **Email Phishing Detection**  
- Detects red flags such as urgency, suspicious requests, and embedded URLs.  
- Fine-tuned on phishing datasets for high precision.  

### 📱 **SMS Phishing Detection (Smishing)**  
- Analyzes brief, context-limited messages for signs of phishing.  
- Combines YAKE's keyword extraction with BERT’s contextual understanding.

## 🚩 **Research Gaps and Challenges**  

### 1. Dataset Imbalance  
- **Problem**: Limited and skewed phishing datasets hinder model performance.  
- **Solution**: Employ data augmentation, oversampling, or synthetic data generation.  

### 2. Interpretability  
- **Problem**: BERT’s complex architecture lacks transparency in predictions.  
- **Solution**: Integrate tools like **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for explainability.  

---

## 🔍 **Conclusion**  
Combining **BERT’s deep contextual understanding** and **YAKE’s lightweight keyword extraction** offers a promising approach to phishing detection. Addressing challenges such as dataset imbalance, interpretability, and computational efficiency will enable scalable and reliable systems for real-world applications.  

### 🚀 **Future Directions**  
- Incorporate multilingual datasets to improve global applicability.  
- Optimize systems for real-time detection.  
- Design intuitive interfaces for better adoption in cybersecurity.
